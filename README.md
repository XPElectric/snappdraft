# Snappdraft Estimation Management System
The digital backbone of XP Electric’s Estimating-as-a-Service (EaaS)—a comprehensive platform to automate, scale, and perfect electrical estimating workflows, designed for acquisition by industry leaders like Trimble, Tradehounds, SparxIQ, or KOJO. *Last Updated: March 09, 2025*

## Vision
- Evolve Snappdraft from a proposal generator into a full estimation management system.
- Automate and centralize all aspects of the XPE estimating method—intake, scoping, job setup, takeoff, pricing, and review.
- Target acquisition by construction tech firms, offering a robust, user-friendly platform with pre-built XPE processes and a gamified user experience.

## Purpose
- Automate the proposal generation process for XP Electric’s estimating services, replacing manual Excel workflows.
- Centralize project data (scope, quotes, client info) for real-time collaboration and remote management.
- Scale EaaS to handle multiple clients, industries, and project types with consistent, error-free outputs.

## Key Features
- **Estimation Workflow Management**: Guide users through the XPE method with structured, gamified levels (see Estimating Quest Levels below).
- **Proposal Generator**: Auto-generate branded proposals from project inputs—scope, counts, quotes, pricing, and "below the line" costs.
- **Client Portal**: Clients can upload bid docs, view EOE, track estimate status, and access reports (integrated with [xp-electric.com.md](xp-electric.com.md)).
- **Data Integration**: Pull from centralized client and vendor databases for faster scoping (e.g., auto-fill client type, industry).
- **Quote Tracking**: Real-time vendor quote management with auto-filled vendor info.
- **Time Tracking Dashboard**: Monitor estimator hours (estimated, HTC, actual, % complete) across projects in real-time.
- **Checklists**: Digital versions of scope, pre-bid, and critical path checklists with Y/N fields and date tracking.
- **Labor Factor Calculator**: Automate NECA labor factor scoring to select the right Accubid labor column, based on [resources/tools/neca_calculator.xlsx](resources/tools/neca_calculator.xlsx).
- **Pre-Bid/Pre-Takeoff Report**: Summarize project analysis to reduce meeting time, sent to clients as a courtesy.
- **Post-Bid Report**: Detailed post-estimate analysis to enhance bid review efficiency.
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in with role-based access and tiered pricing plans.

## Estimating Quest Levels (Gamified Workflow)
